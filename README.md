Generating fake pokemon using Generative Adversarial Network

Using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Netwrok to generate new pokemon using already existing pokemons

Two neural networks pit against each other to improve the authenticity of the fake image

Generator --> generates fake images

Discriminator --> improves generator by showing it how to improve the fake images

we are using pokemon kaggle dataset to generate new pokemon
